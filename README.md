## Usage
- Launch the Archipelago Client, search for `Super Mario Odyssey` and click the `Open` button
- After the client opens, launch your modded SMO installation
- When prompted, the `IP Address` you are connecting to is your computer's local IP address
    - On Switch: this is found by entering the `ipconfig` command into command prompt on Windows
    - On Emulator: leave the IP at its default value: `127.0.0.1`
- When prompted, the `Port` is `1027` by default which does not need to be changed.
- To show these menus again and change your IP and Port, hold ZL while starting the game
- After connecting, both the client and game should display a confirmation message
- Enter the IP and Port for your lobby into the SMO Client. For example: `archipelago.gg:38281`. You will then be prompted for a Username and Password
- At this point, everything should be working and you should be able to send and receive checks

### Usage Tips
- `/smo` can be used to check the status of your connection
- `/warp <kingdom> [scenario]` can be used to warp to any kingdom in any scenario at any time
    - `/warp metro 3` will take you to Festival Metro to avoid [#3](https://github.com/AdalynBlack/SuperMarioOdysseyArchipelago/issues/3)
    - `/warp wooded 3` will take you to post-peace Wooded Kingdom to avoid [#4](https://github.com/AdalynBlack/SuperMarioOdysseyArchipelago/issues/4)
- Depending on when the mod connects to the client, checks may stop sending in some cases. Enter and exit a loading zone to fix this issue
